## Python Virtual Environments
Think of Python Virtual Environments like a container for your Python work. You can create MANY Python virtual environments, and each environment can specialized for different kinds of Python work with different versions of Python even.

1. I suggest using virtualenvwrapper.
2. It's a nice way to manage your virtual environments.
3. However, you can manage them the way that your prefer.
4. See Virtual_Environment_Works.md in the `VirtualEnv\Windows` sub directory.

My favorite definition for pip is "preferred installer program".

3. Sometimes the modules are not named as you would expect.
4. Simply do a google search for "How to pip install such_and_such".
