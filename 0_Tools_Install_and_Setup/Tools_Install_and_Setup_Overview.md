# Overview of Tools and Why We Will Use These

## Google Colab
0. Watch our Google Colab Demo in the `0_Google_Colab` directory.
1. Google Colab is a notebook method of using Python from the cloud. When you use Google Colab, you are not using your system to run Python. You are using Google servers to run Python. 
2. Would you want to use it if you already know how to use Python on your own operating system (OS) from your command line and within an integrated development environment (IDE)? Yes, because you can use GPU's and even TPU's on Google Colab if and when you need them.
3. Google Colab is also a great way to collaborate on coding and program development remotely. 
4. We will use Python in Google Colab in class along with using Python on your own systems in an IDE.
5. There are many good tutorials for Google Colab.
6. It's also quite easy to find specific help for specific actions for Google Colab using a web search.
7. We will show you the basics in the video in the `0_Google_Colab` directory.
8. There are many good tutorials for Google Colab if you want to go deeper in your understanding.

## Python
0. Watch our Python Install and Setup video in `1_Python` to see a Python installation and initial setup of Python.
1. Install the latest stable Python version for your system. IF you are using Linux, GREAT! We recommend using the version of Python that is on your linux distribution - YES, it's already installed. If you have not yet chosen a Linux Distribution, Thom prefers Linux Mint. It's built on top of Ubuntu.
2. While installing on Windows, do make sure to have the Python installation actions add Python to your Path Environment Variables.
3. Once Python is installed, we will guide you through some simple actions to test the installation in the video and in the instructions. You can find both of these in the `1_Python` directory.

## Python Virtual Environments
Think of Python Virtual Environments like a container for your Python work. You can create MANY Python virtual environments, and each environment can be specialized for different kinds of Python work with different versions of Python even.

0. Watch our Python Virtual Environment video and instructions in the `2_Python_Virtual_Environments` directory.
1. We suggest using virtualenvwrapper. virtualenvwrapper simplifies your Python work. It provides nice ways to manage your virtual environments.  However, you can manage them the way that your prefer.
2. By keeping your different types of Python work separate in separate environments, when you need to share your Python work with the world, it will be easier and cleaner to do so. 
3. We will explain more about this throughout the class and you will see the reality of why this is important in your own data science work as you grow.

## The Preferred Installer Program for Python - Pip - Very Easy
1. We will show how to use pip at the system level and in virtual environments. Thus, we will cover some pip installs in the Python installation instructions and in the virtual environments instructions too.
2. Using pip is usually as easy as `pip install <module_name>` .
3. Sometimes the modules are not named as you would expect.
4. Simply do a google search for "How to python pip install such_and_such".

## Git for Windows
Git is a file versioning system. It keeps track of your file version history. It's VERY powerful and was created by Linus Torvalds the creator of Linux. Git can seem complicated. However, using it on your own is quite easy.

0. Please watch the video in the `3_Git_for_Windows` directory.
1. We will be using git's most basic features.
2. Git takes minutes to learn and a LONG time to master, BUT, in my experience, it is worth learning to master it "over" time. 
3. You don't need to learn all its features right away. 
4. Using git as part of a major development team can be quite challenging for those that are not yet familiar with it, but, even in such situations, a "learn new concepts as you need to" approach is OK.

## VS Code - A Popular and Good Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
VS Code is made by Microsoft. It's not open source, but it's free, and it's very popular and nice to use IDE.

0. Watch our install and setup video in the `4_VS_Code` directory
1. Download https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/?dv=win
2. Play around with options in the Welcome Screen
3. Install additional support for Python using the "Welcome Screen"
4. There are good introductory videos in the "Welcome Screen"
5. Tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqCgcpAypFQ
6. Of course, use additional tutorials that you wish or like better
