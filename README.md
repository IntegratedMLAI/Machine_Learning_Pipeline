# The Machine Learning Pipeline
## Thom Ives and Ghaith Sankari

Hi Family Students. This repo holds the files to support our class work.

1. The code and notes to support work for each phase of the class are in directories with a number at the front of the directory name to indicate the suggested order.
2. You will learn some basic git. 
3. If you are on Windows, you will want to install Git for Windows. 
    * You will want to use the ```git bash``` terminal.
    * I suggest installing an SSH key. [You can use this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
    * To clone our course repo from git bash: ```git clone git@github.com:ThomIves/Machine_Learning_Pipeline.git```
    * Change your directory in your git bash terminal to ```Machine_Learning_Pipeline```
    * Each time you come back to the clone of our course directory on your local machine, open git bash in the directory and run ```git pull origin main```. This will update the course directory with the latest updates.
4. Check this main README.md file for updates and notices too. If there are any changes in this file, you will see them after running ```git pull origin main```.
