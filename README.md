# The Machine Learning Pipeline
## Thom Ives and Ghaith Sankari

Hi Family Students. This repo holds the files to support our class work.

1. The code and notes to support work for each phase of the class are in directories with a number at the front of the directory name to indicate the suggested order.
2. You will learn some basic git. 
3. If you are on Windows, you will want to install Git for Windows. 
    * You will want to use git bash.
    * I suggest installing an SSH key. [You can use this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
    * From git bash: ```git clone
